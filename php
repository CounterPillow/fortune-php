I'm not a real programmer. I throw together things until it
works then I move on. The real programmers will say
"Yeah it works but you're leaking memory everywhere. Perhaps we
should fix that." Iâ€™ll just restart Apache every 10 requests.

INF < [] < [0] < [1] < [0, 1] < {} < INF

INF is smaller than itself, greater than itself, not equal (==) to itself, but
identical to itself (===)

There are people who actually like programming. I don't understand why they like programming.

I was really, really bad at writing parsers. I still am really bad at writing parsers.

Roughly eighty percent of the arguments against PHP are rooted in ignorance.

Since then, [PHP] has gone through multiple paradigm shifts, transforming
into a functional language, like C, and then to the fully OOP language
that we enjoy today.

Currently PHP uses a single-pass compilation process, i.e. the parser directly
invokes opcode compilation routines.

Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM

int strcmp ( string $str1 , string $str2 )
Returns < 0 if str1 is less than str2; > 0 if str1 is greater than str2,
and 0 if they are equal.

NOT MENTIONED: strcmp also returns 0 on error.

json_decode takes a flag to choose one of two embedding schemes. One silently
turns empty objects into empty lists, the other replaces "" with "_empty_".

Infinite recursion crashes. There's no fix for that.

(PHP dealing with invalid octals. Both Perl and Python would give you errors in these cases.)
